# Pico8 Basic Racer
A short and simple racer game made in the pico 8.
This code is a challenge to myself to get a minimum viable game running and building up from there.

Controls:
Tap the right arrow button to move the car.

Goal:
Get to the finishline as the blue car before the green car does.
When you win, you are scored on how far ahead of the green car you were.
Every time you win, the green car gets faster. 

Try and get as many points as you can!
